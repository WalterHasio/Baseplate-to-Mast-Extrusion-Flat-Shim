This is a shim to fill the gap between the 19mm Axis baseplate and extrusion of the 19mm aluminum mast. This gap may vary so you can scale the height of the part to adjust the size of thickness. It's 0.3mm thick which works for my setup.  Wrap the part around the top of the mast extrusion, between the two screw holes

then install the baseplate over the part. If it's sized correctly, the mast shouldn't wobble side to side when assembled without the screws.

I have also used zinc sheets cut to the same shape. Plastic sheeting probably works as well. I think some people use aluminum or plastic tape to do the same thing, but I've found that if you put enough tape to fill the gap properly, it's almost impossible to install the baseplate without damaging the tape.

Shims and Adapters
This is a list of various shims and adapters I've designed for foiling, most are available on Thingiverse, but a few are for sale.

Baseplate to Mast Angled Shim - Adjusts the angle of the board to the mast.  This does the same thing as a baseplate shim, but it goes inside the baseplate. Axis 19mm version

Baseplate to Mast Flat Shim - Fills the gap between the baseplate and the sides of the mast extrusion to make the system slighty more rigid. Axis 19mm version

Surf Elementals Mast Adapter - Adapter to use the more rigid 19mm Axis aluminum masts with Takuma foils. Axis 19mm Mast to Takuma Fuselage version

Mast to Fuselage Angled Shim - Adjusts the angle between the mast and the fuselage.  It's similar in function to a baseplate shim, but it goes inside the fuselage.  Takuma version - aluminum Takuma version - printable

Front Foil Flat Shims - Fills the gap in the front wing to fuselage joint.  This should help with issues like the wing coming loose and bolts breaking. (not uploaded yet)

Tail Foil Angled Shims - Adjusts the stabilizer angle relative to the front foil and fuselage.  This can be used to tune foot pressure.  Takuma version
