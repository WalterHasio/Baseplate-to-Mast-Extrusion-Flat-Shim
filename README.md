# Baseplate-to-Mast-Extrusion-Flat-Shim
This is a shim to fill the gap between the 19mm Axis baseplate and extrusion of the 19mm aluminum mast. This gap may vary so you can scale the height of the part to adjust the size of thickness. It's 0.3mm thick which works for my setup.  Wrap the part around the top of the mast extrusion, between the two screw holes
